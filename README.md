# Laboratory 1

## Objective 
- Build a program that alllows to calculate the mean and standard deviation of a set of n numbers 

## Program Description 
The program calculates the mean and standard deviation. for this I used the method calculo that uses a linkedlist implemented in the class LinkedList. the following picture explains the classes design.
